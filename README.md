## To-do!

This repo contains a bunch of vaguely categorised things I'd like to work on (well, more generally, I'd like them to happen and I don't think anyone else will do them given they haven't happened until this point!) at some point.

By and large, there's nothing to suggest priority of any item listed; if you feel sufficiently strongly about anything that you'd pay me to work on it, feel free to drop me an email and we can probably work something out!

If there's related things you think I'd be interested in, feel free to open an issue on this repo (or even a PR!). I make no promises about people adding things to my to-do lists, though. :)
